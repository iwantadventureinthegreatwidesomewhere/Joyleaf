The cannabis industry is one of few that has severely lagged in tech, in large part due to legal complications. With more and more countries legalizing marijuana, consumers want a simple and intuitive experience to finding cannabis perfect for them, both for recreational and medical purposes. Joyleaf is that experience. 

Joyleaf is a strain finder app on iOS and Android that lets you discover over 2,000 unique marijuana strains from around the world so you can find cannabis perfect for you.

I led a team of three other developers, who primarily worked on front-end development and algorithm design for our REST API.

I used Xamarin Forms, a .NET cross-platform UI framework, to deliver a smooth, native, front-end experience for both iOS and Android, with a C#-shared codebase to boost development workflow. 

I developed the back-end with Firebase in order to authenticate users, store app data, and host a REST API. 

I also used Sketch and Photoshop to design all the visual components, including the app icon, splash screens, promotional media, and all the glyphs in the app.
